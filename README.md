# BlackjackProject

## Description
 This is a console based application that simulates a game of blackjack. The game allows the user to choose to place a bet if they desire, and alters their account of tokens after each game. The game also allows the user to choose the number of other players at the table, though currently all others are non playable. Right now, only the basic rules are incoorperated into the game, beyond the betting. 

## Lessons Learned

* I started this project not knowing most of the rules for the game of blackjack, so I needed to do some research to understand them. 
* This project went more in depth with the fundamentals of OOP, and I needed to spend time mapping out each object, and the relationships between them. For instance all "PersonAtTable" Objects needed to have a "hand", and each "hand" needed a list of cards from the "deck". 
*Because most of the logic for the program, and all of the user input, is in the main (BlackJackApp) class, I had to spend time reorganizing my code to ensure that it was readable and logical from an OOP perspective. 

## Technology used

* I utilized google to research the rules for blackjack.
* The Eclipse IDE was used to build  and test the program.
* I used the apple terminal to commit and push the project to GitHub when significant progress was made.
* Git/GitHub was used for version control and as an online backup for my work.
